# happy-table-mapper

An application that helps users analyze the output guesses from an ai. The ai is looking at a database table schema and some of its sample data and categorizing the business concept that each data element relates to. The AI will map the database table and corresponding business concepts into a desired target schema that is native to the app you are creating called happy table. The user should be able to correct the guesses from the AI and also view summary metrics about the data in the current table we are mapping to happy table schema
